## What is Science Co-op?

Co-operative Education is a structured method of combining classroom-based education with practical work experience. Co-op is extremely beneficial when it comes to making the transition from school-to-career. As an undergraduate student, Co-op can also help you to discover the career path that you may want to pursue after graduation.

Co-op students complete three, 4-month work terms in various employment settings:
* Private industry
* Provincial and Federal Government
* Academic research (Only USRAs can be counted as Co-op work terms; deadlines are usually in January, so may not be a first work term but is useful for graduate studies)

*8 month work terms are permitted, 12 months not*

- Local partners:
  - Priceline, Richardson, Ubisoft
  - Niche, Investors Group, Manitoba Hydro
  - Payworks, Bison Transport
  - Blaze
- Other partnerships (haven't seen much of that lately, especially American placements):
  - RBC (hires a lot of students in Toronto)
  - Google
  - Amazon
  - Microsoft
  - IBM
  - Shopify
  - Triumf
  - EA
  - **Note**: Most of these are independent job searches by students
  - Highest wage ever seen was from Pinterest, 60 USD/hour
- Government:
  - Agriculture and Agri Food Canada (hires a lot of students)
  - Federal and Manitoban government
  - **Note**: International Students are *not* typically eligible for Federal Government opportunities, but are for Provincial and Municipal
- Faculty of Science Undergraduate Student Research Awards (USRAs)
  - Joint students usually have different schedules and require individual plans
  - Lots of joint students will look for USRA in the other discipline for their first work term to compensate about having a weaker CS base

Co-op opportunities exist around the globe. *Travel advisories are adhered to.*
- Not specifically CS Co-op students
- Germany, China, United States

How does Co-op work?
- Students alternate between work terms and academic terms in their 3rd - 5th year.
- By graduation, students have 12 months of relevant work experience with as many as three different employers.
- Each work term spans for a minimum of 12 weeks to maximum of 16 weeks, (16 weeks is most common).
  - Outside internships are fine for credit as long as they're 12 weeks minimum
- Positions are paid, and are full time.
- **Note**: You can do 8-month work terms, but not any longer than that.
  - Students usually do with the same employer, different employers are a bit tricky
- Students pay a co-op work term fee for each of their placements. Approximately $620/term.
  - You aren't technically in the program until you actually get a job
  - When you get a job is when you pay the work term fee
- Co-op work terms are zero credit hours.
- Co-op work terms are graded as Pass/Fail.
  - It is hard, but possible, to fail
  - Story: Was driving home after a site visit when the Manitoban government called to say the student quit and was never coming back
- Students are permitted to take 1 course during a work term, must be an evening or distance course (usually an elective)
- Wages (local):
  - CS Co-op minimum wage $18.50/hr
  - Average wage: $23/hr
  - Highest wage: $30/hr
  - Will fluctuate depending on location
- Full-time hours: 35-40 hours of work per week, for 16 weeks
  - When looking at transcript, wants to see full-time students
  - Part-time students look concerning as full-time jobs require learning a lot of information every day

- Schedule
  1. Regular stream (Computer Science Major and Honours)
    - Year 3: Fall - Academic Term + Co-op Prep, Winter - Work Term 1, Summer - Academic Term
      - **Must** do full-time studies in Summer, which is brutal; usually taking courses like Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Distributed Computing
    - Year 4: Fall - Work Term 2, Winter - Academic Term, Summer - Work Term 3
    - Year 5: Fall - Academic Term, Winter - *Graduate*
    - *Must start and end on an academic term while maintaining full-time student status.*
    - Schedules can be customized *if discussed and approved* by the Co-op office.
    - You will graduate either 8 or 12 months later, however we think it's worth it, and so will YOU!
  2. International students (Computer Science Major and Honours)
    - Year 3: Fall - Academic Term + Co-op Prep, Winter - Academic Term, Summer - Work Term 1
    - Year 4: Fall - Work Term 2 (or Academic Term), Winter - Academic Term (or Work Term 2), Summer - Work Term 3
    - Year 5: Fall - Academic Term, Winter - Academic Term, Summer - *Graduate*
    - The schedule is tailored as Co-op Work Permits take a long time to process, deferring them by one work term
  3. Joint Honours - Math/Physics/ Statistics
    - Year 2: Fall - Academic Term + Co-op Application
    - Due to the unique nature, students are required to apply out of stream. JH students interested in Co-op, should make an appointment with a Co-op coordinator as soon as they've declared their major. Each student will be responsible for creating an academic plan that incorporates three Co-op work terms. The Co-op schedule for "regular stream" Joint Honours students is three consecutive summers due to course availability and program requirements.
    - **Note**: It's up to you to figure out the schedule, they won't do that for you

- Benefits:
  - FINANCE education
    - Money is one reason, but helps budgeting
  - Improve ACADEMIC performance
    - Many situations where students go to work term and things click as they're applied in the real world
    - Working on codebases with thousands of lines instead of your assignment
    - Some B students jump to an A students
  - Access EXCLUSIVE opportunities
    - Lots of employer partners that just post within our program
    - First co-op program in the university, since 1980s, so lots of companies bail their staff based on the program
    - If people are hiring, Co-ops are basically 4-month interview, if you do good they'll hire you
  - Gain RELEVANT work experience
    - Lots of students get part time jobs, but relevant experience positions you well in the future
  - Build a professional NETWORK
    - Instead of your LinkedIn having family and friends, you expand it to professional people
    - You'll be able to tap them for different connections and references as you go through your career
    - The earlier student who went to Pinterest went to Amazon in Work Term 2 because the recruiter who was from Pinterest referred him
  - Expand TECHNICAL and TRANSFERABLE skills
  - Gain CAREER CLARITY
    - Gain a better idea of what you want to do after education by trying many things
  - Increase EMPLOYABILITY
    - Learn project management, teamwork, and presentation skills
    - Confidence is the biggest thing, students transform after their first work term and become more prepared

## Requirements

- Minimum GPA - your GPA is important, but it's not everything.
  - 2.50 Major
  - 3.00 Honours
  - Many people ask what the actual "magic number" true lowest GPA is - there is none, becuase we look at three things
    - It's competitive, but people don't look at just GPA, just trends (upward trends, downward trends, VWs)
    - If a student did poorly in Engineering and does wonderful in CS, of course gonna look at that students
    - The second thing is your resume, the third is the interview, which not everyone make it to
- It is strongly recommended that applicants to Computer Science Co-op complete ALL of their second-year courses (COMP 2080, 2140, 2150, 2160, and 2280) by the end of Winter term in their second year of study. This ensures students possess the minimum technical skills required by employers, before being admitted to Co-op. Applicants who will not have their 2nd year courses completed by the time of application CAN still apply. These applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
- Should be between 54-90 credit hours by December 2025.

### Brief Q&A
- **What about the new second year courses?** Not relevant yet especially if you're pursuing Co-op *now*, and is told to not broadcast about that yet.
- **Any differences between Domestic and International?** No, Co-op Work Term fees are the same too!
- **Do you need less than 90 credit hours?** Some people change from different things, so it's not a hard requirement. The main concern is whether you have enough time left in your program. If you can show you can build a schedule to complete 3 Work Terms, it's fair game. We're not a job agency, it's an optional academic program, the idea is you complete it fully so when you graduate you have a Co-op designation. Also, if you stay in Winnipeg, being in Co-op is a big deal. Don't want to limit everybody, just need the full picture.
- **Academic terms are full time, for SAS students it's 40%, is that okay?** Full-time is usually 60%, or 3 classes, for SAS students full-time is 2 classes or 40% so if you show the paper you're good to go.
- **If I find a job on my own, do I still need to pay the fee?** Yes, you have to pay, because it's like tuition. We're registering you in SCI 3980, 3990, etc. so as soon as you're enrolled the fee is attached to the course and you have to pay.
- **What if I find a job in my home country?** If you show me a description as I need to make sure your job aligns with your education, so if you show an offer letter signed by you and your employer that'll be fine. Need to consider employment taxes, but students have been to Japan and China so it should be fine.
- 90 is not a hard and fast rule, especially for second-degree students.
- There's a lot of students who secure internships independent of Co-op. Reality is many people in this room will not be in Co-op, but you can go on and do amazing things without it. Some students go out, get jobs, and sign it up as Co-op, but that's not a way into the program. You have to come through the regular channels, get accepted by anybody else, you can't just say you have a job. We love if you find your own jobs, that's one position more on our job board, and might even secure us new partners. Need to verify the job, know if it's full time, competitive wage, relevant. Some students have come with internships that forced them to pay.
- **What would you say the acceptance rate is?** Last year, acceptance rate was around 50~60%, which isn't good. That's what it was last year, may not be the same this year. For those with friends in the Co-op program, the job market is really tough last 12 to 18 months, struggling to find placements for students. Would be naive to take on students without guaranteeing them placements. This year is likely to be a smaller group.
- **How many people actually apply?** Last year had 124 applications, did 91 interviews. The year before was 191 applications, so it's a lot.

### SUBMIT A PLAN
- Second degree?
- Transfer student?
- High on credit hours?
- If your application does not align with the regular stream criteria, you must submit your own plan. Must have a table with terms for columns, years for row, and insert courses with work terms appropriately.
- **Note**: It is a bad idea to try doing 5 courses in Co-op. Writing cover letters and interview prepping is basically an entire course.

### Registration for upcoming year
- Make it a priority to register for courses in July, otherwise you might be disappointed.
- **Register for winter term as well**, if you are accepted into Co-op and secure a position, you will drop your courses once you are registered in the work term.
  - Do not risk not having placements nor full-time studies
- You are required to be a full-time student, minimum of 3 courses every term while in the Co-op program - including Summer! *(Excluding students who have an accommodation with SAS)*
- **Important course for Fall: COMP 3380 - Databases Concepts and Usage.*
  - Most applicable courses are COMP 2150, 3380, 3350 (though it's not)
- CAUTION - Five courses plus Co-op not recommended!

### HOW TO POSITION YOURSELF FOR CO-OP
- Build work and volunteer experience
- Get involved, participate!
- Apply yourself in your studies

YOUR INITIAL APPLICATION TO CO-OP WILL CONSIST OF YOUR RESUME, TRANSCRIPT (Unofficial) (don't order it) AND A BASIC ONLINE FORM (Profile Info)

Your resume should be formatted professionally, please take time to prepare something that you are proud of (view some resume samples, get feedback from your network). First impressions are important!

Your resume must include ALL of your experiences to date - work and volunteer experience, education and other forms of professional development, projects, extracurricular activities and perhaps even your *hobbies/interests*. **Your experience does not need to be related to Computer Science, list all jobs!**

## Questions

1. By adding as much as you can to your resume, is there a maximum?
- Two pages max, if you do more we don't want it. Nobody in your position should have more pages.
2. One-and-a-half pages?
- Either one or two, one page and a little bit look bad. Big tech companies want one in USA, they call it the "Executive Summary" as they only want what's from you that's relevant to them. Local companies like longer resumes. Good idea to have two versions.
3. Technical interviews?
- Some will, some won't best bet is to be prepared. Technical questions aren't necessarily coding questions, just asking what you should know like what is OOP.
4. For applications, if you have referrals can you involve it?
- Just apply, don't name drop. We don't go by conflict of interest, tl;dr referrals are not factors
5. Have to apply from April, but grades this term will be posted so will it matter?
- Will go in and collect all the data for a master spreadsheet.
6. Then why do you ask for the transcript if you have the data?
- It's not just the grades, but the trends, as much information possible is good.
7. When you apply for jobs, do we need to let you know?
- Don't need to let us know every time, if every one tells us what they're doing it'd be overwhelming. Looping us in is fine, tell us if something happens like an interview. What you MUST tell is if you GET a job.
8. Honours and Major?
- Doesn't matter, even to employers.
9. In Co-op, can you do interviews in another country?
- We do interviews May, June, July, we can accommodate remote interviews. For actual job applications, it's highly unlikely.
10. In Joint Honours, can mix work placements between discipline?
- Yes.
11. Do you prioritize early applicants?
- It's a trend, students who are really keen and prepared apply early, but we don't take into consideration. We technically do it alphabetically, only Bri knows.
12. Do you like VWs?
- VWs are fine if they're not repetitive. If every term you VW, that's an issue. Sometimes you fail a class if that's okay, some overachievers who fail to get an A consider dropping courses and come into us panicking, but the world is not gonna end if you get a C.
13. Do I need to include every description of every job?
- Under each job or project, should have a couple bullet points that describe what that was all about.
14. Should there be specific fonts and sizes in the resume?
- We will tell you all about that in Resume Workshop, but this is a preference thing. Lisa likes Tahoma, Caligry, 11 or 12, but NOT Times New Roman.
15. What if your academic term has one more at the end?
- That's fine.
16. If you get into Co-op, but you don't get a job, what happens?
- It doesn't happen consistently because we don't let it. You get into Co-op, apply for jobs, sometimes you don't get it. If you demonstrate commitment, we'll carry you over one term to try again. We don't let you pick-and-choose the schedule. If you're unsuccessful a second time, that's it. We also look at the grades for that term.
17. If I fail to get a job in Summer the first time, do I have to study in Summer?
- If you're in "limbo", we recommend that you do, but you don't have to.
18. Do you include experience before university?
- Yes.
19. Should you disclose disability on your resume?
- No, short answer. You can have disclosure on cover letters or maybe interviews, but not on the resume.
20. If a student in Co-op get a 4-month internship through the Federal Work Experience program or STEP, does that count?
- Yes, but they may have restrictions stating otherwise.
21. If I have exactly 30 crs left, should I plan for contigencies?
- Yes, make plans for contigencies. Don't plan for everything based on Co-op, sometimes it doesn't work out.
22. How many students actually got a job out of 90 last year?
- We only accepted 77 students last year. Hard question, because not everyone apply the same time. Can say that not everybody got a job, but there were under 10, around 8 carry-overs.
